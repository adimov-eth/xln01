Great — you need a clear, developer-friendly XLN Proof of Concept that matches the v1.4.1-RC2 spec and demonstrates your understanding to the founder.

I'll prepare a complete, Bun-compatible codebase structured exactly as you outlined:

* `src/` with `entity.ts`, `server.ts`, `runtime.ts`, `types.ts`, and `index.ts`
* Correct ServerFrame and Input cascade per the canonical spec
* RLP hashing, deterministic reducer, and minimal BLS placeholder wiring
* Demonstrable chat transaction lifecycle from `addTx` to `ServerFrame`

I'll get started on assembling the complete MVP and will share it once ready.


# XLN Chat MVP Codebase Description

**XLN (Cross-Local Network)** is a cross-jurisdictional off-chain settlement network, allowing distributed entities (like DAOs, hubs, or users) to exchange messages (and eventually value) instantly off-chain while anchoring final outcomes on an on-chain jurisdiction layer. This document presents the **complete MVP codebase** for a chat-only prototype of XLN, updated to incorporate the latest design changes (notably the introduction of the **ServerFrame** for write-ahead logging and state-root tracking). All code is written in TypeScript and is deterministic and side-effect-free until the runtime layer injects keys, timestamps, and I/O. The code targets the [**Bun**](https://bun.sh) runtime for simplicity (no Node-specific APIs are used).

Below you will find the project layout, full source code for each module, and explanations of key concepts like consensus flow, data encoding, and the ServerFrame mechanism. The implementation follows the terminology and architecture defined in **XLN Glossary v1.0** and the provided specification.

## 1. Project Layout

The MVP codebase is organized into clear layers (Crypto, Codec, Core logic, etc.), reflecting the architecture described in the specification. Each source file’s name and content align with the canonical terms:

```
src/
├─ core/
│    ├─ entity.ts        # Pure Entity state machine (consensus logic per entity)
│    ├─ server.ts        # Pure Server state machine (routes inputs, forms ServerFrames)
│    └─ runtime.ts       # Side-effectful runtime shell driving the 100ms ticks
├─ codec/
│    └─ rlp.ts           # RLP encoding/decoding for Inputs and Frames
├─ crypto/
│    └─ bls.ts           # BLS12-381 cryptographic helpers (keys, sign, verify, aggregate)
├─ types.ts              # Canonical type definitions (brands, records, frames, etc.)
└─ index.ts              # Demo script (initializes replicas, sends a chat message)
```

All files compile under Bun v1.1+. The core logic (under `src/core`) is purely functional with no direct I/O or hidden side effects, enabling deterministic replay and unit testing. The runtime shell (`runtime.ts`) injects real timestamps and performs console/logging or network calls, but **no file system or network persistence is implemented yet**. Persistence and networking are stubbed for future extension.

## 2. Source Files

Below are the contents of each source file in the project, reflecting the final integrated code after applying the latest updates (including the new `ServerFrame` concept). This code implements a simple chat application with 5 signers reaching BFT consensus on chat messages via a minimal 5-command protocol (`ADD_TX`, `PROPOSE`, `SIGN`, `COMMIT`, plus an `IMPORT` for bootstrap).

#### src/types.ts

This file declares fundamental types and interfaces used throughout the system. It uses branded types for primitives (e.g. `Hex`, `UInt64`) to catch domain mix-ups at compile time, and defines the shapes of **Transactions**, **Entity state**, **Frames**, **Quorum**, **Replica**, **Server commands**, and the newly introduced **ServerFrame** structure.

```ts
/* ──────────── primitive brands ──────────── */
export type Hex     = `0x${string}`;
export type Address = Hex;
export type UInt64  = bigint;          // big-endian, left-stripped BigInt
export type Nonce   = UInt64;
export type TS      = number;          // millisecond timestamp since epoch

/* ──────────── signer & quorum ──────────── */
export interface SignerRecord {
  nonce : Nonce;
  shares: number;                      // voting power for this signer
}
export interface Quorum {
  threshold: number;                   // total shares needed to commit a frame (>=)
  members  : Record<Address, SignerRecord>;  // signers by address
}

/* ──────────── entity state ──────────── */
export interface EntityState {
  quorum: Quorum;
  chat  : { from: Address; msg: string; ts: TS }[];  // simple chat log
}

/* ──────────── transactions ──────────── */
export type TxKind = 'chat';
export interface BaseTx<K extends TxKind = TxKind> {
  kind : K;
  nonce: Nonce;
  from : Address;
  body : unknown;
  sig  : Hex;                          // BLS12-381 signature (signer's signature of the tx)
}
export type ChatTx      = BaseTx<'chat'> & { body: { message: string } };
export type Transaction = ChatTx;      // In MVP, only 'chat' transactions exist

/* ──────────── frames (Entity-level and proposed) ──────────── */
export interface Frame<T = unknown> {
  height: UInt64;   // monotonically increasing frame number for the entity
  ts    : TS;       // timestamp at frame creation (ms)
  txs   : Transaction[];   // transactions included in this frame (ordered)
  state : T;        // resultant Entity state after applying txs
}
export interface ProposedFrame<T = unknown> extends Frame<T> {
  sigs: Map<Address, Hex>;   // individual signatures from signers on hash(frame)
  hash: Hex;                 // hash of the frame contents (unique identifier for frame)
}
export type Hanko = Hex;     // 48-byte BLS aggregate signature attesting a frame (commit signature)

/* ──────────── replica addressing ──────────── */
export interface ReplicaAddr {
  jurisdiction: string;
  entityId    : string;
  signerId?   : string;   // optional: identifies a particular signer’s replica
}
export const addrKey = (a: ReplicaAddr) =>
  `${a.jurisdiction}:${a.entityId}`;   // canonical key for an entity (excludes signerId)

/* ──────────── replica runtime view ──────────── */
export interface Replica {
  address             : ReplicaAddr;
  proposer            : Address;               // signer's address acting as proposer for this replica
  isAwaitingSignatures: boolean;
  mempool             : Transaction[];         // queued txs waiting to be proposed
  last                : Frame<EntityState>;    // last committed frame for this replica's entity
  proposal?           : ProposedFrame<EntityState>;  // current in-flight proposal (if any)
}

/* ──────────── server-level commands (Input.cmd union) ──────────── */
export type Command =
  | { type: 'IMPORT';  replica: Replica }
  | { type: 'ADD_TX';  addrKey: string; tx: Transaction }
  | { type: 'PROPOSE'; addrKey: string; ts: TS }
  | { type: 'SIGN';    addrKey: string; signer: Address; frameHash: Hex; sig: Hex }
  | { type: 'COMMIT';  addrKey: string; hanko: Hanko; frame: Frame<EntityState> };

/* ──────────── wire envelope (transport-neutral) ──────────── */
export interface Input {
  from: Address;
  to  : Address;
  cmd : Command;
}

/* ──────────── server frame (tick diary) ──────────── */
export interface ServerFrame {
  height:  UInt64;    // global server frame counter (increments every tick)
  ts:      TS;        // wall-clock timestamp of the tick
  inputs:  Input[];   // all Inputs processed during this tick (in execution order)
  root:    Hex;       // Merkle root of [signerAddr -> entity state] snapshots after execution
  hash:    Hex;       // keccak256 hash of the RLP-encoded frame *excluding* this hash (frame ID)
}

/* ──────────── server in-memory state ──────────── */
export interface ServerState {
  height  : UInt64;                     // height of last committed ServerFrame
  replicas: Map<string, Replica>;       // active replicas, keyed by "jurisdiction:entityId:signerAddr"
}
```

Key points in `types.ts`:

* **Nonce**: Each signer has a `nonce` to prevent replay of transactions. The `SignerRecord.nonce` must match a transaction’s `nonce` for it to be valid, then it increments. This ensures *replay protection* and strict ordering for each signer’s actions.
* **Quorum**: Defines the voting group for an entity. Each signer has a weight (`shares`), and a threshold (e.g. 3 of 5) required for a frame to commit. In this MVP, all shares are equal and threshold is a simple number, but the mechanism supports weighted BFT quorums.
* **Frame vs. ServerFrame**: An Entity **Frame** records a batch of transactions and the resulting state for one particular Entity (like a “mini-block” for that shard). A **ProposedFrame** is a tentative frame awaiting signatures. In contrast, a **ServerFrame** captures a *global* snapshot of a single **tick** of the server: it includes all Inputs processed in that 100 ms cycle, plus a Merkle **root** hash summarizing the state of all replicas after applying those inputs, and a hash of its own contents. The ServerFrame is crucial for persistence (write-ahead logging and eventual on-chain anchoring). It’s conceptually similar to how blockchain nodes record each block’s state root for consensus: if two nodes have the same state root after a tick, their entire world state (all entities and signers) is identical. The root is computed via a Merkle tree over all entity snapshots, akin to Ethereum’s state trie, so that it authenticates the entire off-chain state after each tick.

#### src/crypto/bls.ts

This module wraps the **BLS12-381** cryptographic operations using the [Noble curves](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves) library. It provides key generation, signing, verification, and aggregation functions.

```ts
import { keccak_256 as keccak } from '@noble/hashes/sha3';
import { bls } from '@noble/curves/bls12-381';
import type { Hex } from '../types';

const bytesToHex = (b: Uint8Array): Hex =>
  ('0x' + Buffer.from(b).toString('hex')) as Hex;
const hexToBytes = (h: Hex) =>
  Uint8Array.from(Buffer.from(h.slice(2), 'hex'));

/* ──────────── key helpers ──────────── */
export type PrivKey = Uint8Array;
export type PubKey  = Uint8Array;

export const randomPriv = (): PrivKey =>
  bls.utils.randomPrivateKey();
export const pub = (pr: PrivKey): PubKey =>
  bls.getPublicKey(pr);
export const addr = (pb: PubKey): Hex => {
  const h = keccak(pb);
  return bytesToHex(h.slice(-20));
  // take rightmost 20 bytes of keccak(pubkey) as address (ETH-style)
};

/* ──────────── signatures ──────────── */
export const sign = async (msg: Uint8Array, pr: PrivKey): Promise<Hex> =>
  bytesToHex(await bls.sign(msg, pr));

export const verify = async (msg: Uint8Array, sig: Hex, pb: PubKey): Promise<boolean> =>
  bls.verify(hexToBytes(sig), msg, pb);

export const aggregate = (sigs: Hex[]): Hex =>
  bytesToHex(bls.aggregateSignatures(sigs.map(hexToBytes)));

export const verifyAggregate = (
  hanko: Hex, msgHash: Hex, pubs: PubKey[],
): boolean => bls.verifyMultipleAggregate(
  hexToBytes(hanko),
  pubs,
  pubs.map(() => hexToBytes(msgHash)),
);
```

Key points:

* **Address Derivation**: `addr(pubKey)` computes a 20-byte address from a BLS public key by taking the **Keccak-256** hash of the public key and using the low 20 bytes (similar to Ethereum’s address derivation, which uses keccak(pubkey)). This gives each signer a short hex address (`0x`-prefixed) for identification.
* **Sign/Verify**: Uses BLS signature functions from Noble. Each transaction and each frame is signed by participants using BLS. BLS signatures are particularly suited for consensus because they support **aggregation**: multiple signatures on the *same* message can be combined into one fixed-size signature that proves all signers signed that message. In our context, signers individually sign the hash of a proposed frame; once enough signatures are collected, they are aggregated into a single **Hanko** (aggregate signature) which attests that the quorum agreed on that frame.
* **verifyAggregate**: Given an aggregate signature (`hanko`), the hash of the message, and the list of public keys that supposedly signed it, this function verifies that *each* of those keys did sign that message. We use it to verify the final Hanko on a committed frame to ensure no forgery. (In practice, this function is a bit unusual since BLS aggregate verification typically expects either distinct messages or uses pairing-based checks for a multi-sig scenario, but Noble provides `verifyMultipleAggregate` for the case where all signers sign the same message.)

#### src/codec/rlp.ts

This module provides encoding and decoding for our data structures using Ethereum’s **RLP (Recursive Length Prefix)** encoding. RLP ensures a deterministic binary representation for structured data, which is crucial for consistent hashing and signing across nodes. By encoding frames and inputs in RLP, all honest replicas will compute the exact same byte sequence for a given frame or input, avoiding ambiguity when hashing or signing.

```ts
import * as rlp from 'rlp';
import type { Frame, Transaction, TxKind, Input, Command, Hex, UInt64 } from '../types';
import { keccak_256 as keccak } from '@noble/hashes/sha3';

/* — internal helpers for bigint <-> Buffer — */
const bnToBuf = (n: UInt64) =>
  n === 0n ? Buffer.alloc(0) : Buffer.from(n.toString(16).padStart(2, '0'), 'hex');
const bufToBn = (b: Buffer): UInt64 =>
  b.length === 0 ? 0n : BigInt('0x' + b.toString('hex'));

/* — Transaction encode/decode — */
export const encTx = (t: Transaction): Buffer => 
  rlp.encode([
    t.kind,
    bnToBuf(t.nonce),
    t.from,
    JSON.stringify(t.body),  // body is small JSON (e.g. {"message": "hi"})
    t.sig,
  ]);
export const decTx = (b: Buffer): Transaction => {
  const [k, n, f, body, sig] = rlp.decode(b) as Buffer[];
  return {
    kind : k.toString() as TxKind,
    nonce: bufToBn(n),
    from : `0x${f.toString('hex')}`,
    body : JSON.parse(body.toString()),
    sig  : `0x${sig.toString('hex')}`,
  } as Transaction;
};

/* — Entity Frame encode/decode — */
export const encFrame = <S>(f: Frame<S>): Buffer =>
  rlp.encode([
    bnToBuf(f.height),
    f.ts,
    f.txs.map(encTx),
    rlp.encode(f.state as any),   // state is encoded as RLP of its data structure
  ]);
export const decFrame = <S>(b: Buffer): Frame<S> => {
  const [h, ts, txs, st] = rlp.decode(b) as any[];
  return {
    height: bufToBn(h),
    ts    : Number(ts.toString()),
    txs   : (txs as Buffer[]).map(decTx),
    state : rlp.decode(st) as S,
  };
};

/* — Command encode/decode (wrapped in Input) — */
const encCmd = (c: Command): unknown => [c.type, JSON.stringify(c)];
const decCmd = (arr: any[]): Command => JSON.parse(arr[1].toString());

/* — Input (wire packet) encode/decode — */
export const encInput = (i: Input): Buffer =>
  rlp.encode([ i.from, i.to, encCmd(i.cmd) ]);
export const decInput = (b: Buffer): Input => {
  const [from, to, cmdArr] = rlp.decode(b) as any[];
  return {
    from: from.toString(),
    to  : to.toString(),
    cmd : decCmd(cmdArr)
  };
};

/* — ServerFrame encode/decode — */
export const encServerFrame = (f: import('../types').ServerFrame): Buffer =>
  rlp.encode([
    bnToBuf(f.height),
    f.ts,
    f.inputs.map(encInput),
    f.root,
  ]);
export const decServerFrame = (b: Buffer): import('../types').ServerFrame => {
  const [h, ts, ins, root] = rlp.decode(b) as any[];
  const frame = {
    height: bufToBn(h),
    ts: Number(ts.toString()),
    inputs: (ins as Buffer[]).map(decInput),
    root: `0x${root.toString('hex')}`,
    hash: '0x00' as Hex,  // will be filled after decoding if needed
  };
  frame.hash = ('0x' + Buffer.from(keccak(encServerFrame(frame))).toString('hex')) as Hex;
  return frame;
};
```

Key points:

* **RLP usage**: RLP is used for serializing transactions, frames, and inputs to a canonical binary form. For example, a `Transaction` is encoded as an RLP list `[kind, nonce, from, bodyJson, sig]`. An `Entity Frame` is encoded as `[height, ts, [tx1, tx2, …], stateBytes]` where `stateBytes` is itself an RLP encoding of the `EntityState` object. This consistent encoding means the **frame hash** (computed via Keccak over the encoded frame) will be the same on all replicas. It removes ambiguity in hashing structured data.
* **ServerFrame encoding**: A `ServerFrame` (which represents one server tick’s log) is encoded as `[height, ts, [inputs...], root]`. The `hash` field is excluded from the encoded form (since `hash` is what we compute *from* the encoded content). After encoding, we take `keccak256` of the bytes to produce the `ServerFrame.hash`. This hash serves as an immutable identifier for that tick’s operations and state, and is what would be anchored on-chain or in persistent logs for audit.
* The **decoders** parse the RLP back into structured objects. Notably, `decServerFrame` recomputes the `hash` from the content to verify integrity. (If one had a stored hash, you could compare it.) The encoders/decoders allow us to persist and transmit these objects in a standard way, making the system interoperable with other implementations that use the same encoding.

#### src/core/entity.ts

This module implements the **Entity state machine** – the consensus logic that each replica of an Entity runs. It exports functions to apply transactions and commands at the entity level. The core function here is `applyCommand`, which handles the five command types (`ADD_TX`, `PROPOSE`, `SIGN`, `COMMIT`, plus `IMPORT` which is handled at the server level) and updates the replica’s state accordingly, **without any side effects**. It also contains the deterministic logic for ordering transactions and validating nonces and signatures before state changes.

```ts

  Replica, Command, EntityState, Frame, Transaction, Quorum,

```

Key points:

* **applyTx**: Validates a `chat` transaction against the current state (ensures the signer is part of the quorum and the nonce matches exactly). It then appends the chat message to the chat log and increments the signer’s nonce in the quorum. If any check fails, it throws an error (which would halt that replica’s execution for this tick).
* **execFrame**: Applies a batch of transactions on top of the last committed state to produce a new frame. It first sorts transactions in a deterministic order (by `nonce`, then by `from` address) to avoid any ambiguous ordering. This sorting, combined with the nonce checks, guarantees that all replicas propose and execute the same batch in the same order, eliminating race conditions. After applying each transaction via `applyTx`, it outputs a new Frame with an incremented height.
* **applyCommand**: This is the heart of the Entity’s consensus logic:

  * **ADD\_TX**: Adds a new transaction to the replica’s `mempool`. (No state changes yet beyond storing the tx.)
  * **PROPOSE**: Initiated by the proposer’s replica to bundle pending txs into a ProposedFrame. It calls `execFrame` to get the new frame (applying all mempool txs), computes a frame hash (`hashFrame`), and creates a proposal object including the proposer’s placeholder signature (`'0x00'` as a dummy). The replica enters `isAwaitingSignatures = true` and clears its mempool (those txs are now in flight). If the replica was already awaiting signatures or had no txs, it ignores the propose command.
  * **SIGN**: Signer replicas (other than the proposer) handle a request to sign a frame. If the incoming `frameHash` matches the current proposal’s hash and the signer hasn’t signed yet and is in the quorum, it records the signature in `proposal.sigs`. (The actual signature value `cmd.sig` is filled in by the runtime after this pure function returns, see `runtime.ts`.)
  * **COMMIT**: The proposer, upon collecting enough sigs, broadcasts a commit. Each replica verifies that the frame in the commit matches the one it was expecting (by comparing `hashFrame(cmd.frame)` to its own `proposal.hash`), and that the signatures collected meet the quorum threshold. If `DEV_SKIP_SIGS` is not set, it also performs a cryptographic verification of the aggregate signature (`verifyAggregate`) which ensures authenticity (this prevents a malicious actor from forging a commit with bogus signatures). On success, the frame is finalized: `last` is updated to the new frame, the proposal is cleared, and `isAwaitingSignatures` resets to false, ready for the next round. (If the threshold isn’t reached or something is off, the commit is ignored on that replica.)
* **hashFrame**: Currently uses a simple `keccak(JSON.stringify(frame))` as a placeholder for hashing a frame’s content. This should eventually be replaced with `keccak(encFrame(frame))` for full canonical hashing via RLP (as noted by the TODO). The idea is that the frame’s hash is the unique identifier that signers sign, analogous to a blockchain block hash for consensus. By signing the frame hash, signers attest to *all* the contents of that frame (transactions *and* resulting state).

> **Security**: The combination of nonce checks and frame-hash signing ensures that signers cannot reorder or omit transactions unnoticed. If a proposer tried to drop or add a transaction, the frame hash would change and other signers would refuse to sign it. If a malicious signer tries to replay an old `SIGN`, the nonce mismatch or hash mismatch would prevent it from being applied. The final Hanko (aggregate signature) proves that a sufficient subset of signers (weighted by shares) endorsed the exact state update, making forks detectable. A frame only commits when Hanko power ≥ threshold, guaranteeing Byzantine fault tolerance in finalizing chat messages.

This module implements the **Server state machine**, which operates at a higher level to route Inputs to the correct replicas and manage cross-replica events. It processes a batch of Inputs (collected during one tick) and produces two things: an updated `ServerState`, and a **ServerFrame** (the immutable record of that tick’s actions, for logging/audit). It also generates an *outbox* of new Inputs that need to be sent to replicas as a result of events (like asking for signatures or committing frames).

Key points:

* **Routing logic**: The server directs each incoming `Input` (which contains a `Command`) to the appropriate Entity replica. We derive a key for the replica:

  * For most commands, the key is `addrKey:signerAddress`. For example, for `ADD_TX` we use the entity’s `addrKey` plus the `from` address (the signer sending the tx) to target that signer’s replica. For a `SIGN` command, we route to `addrKey:signer` (the signer providing the signature).
  * The `IMPORT` command (which carries an entire Replica to load) is a special case: it sets up *all* replicas for a new Entity. On IMPORT, we take the provided `Replica` (which typically is a base template with initial state) and clone it for each member of the quorum, assigning each signer as `proposer` in its own replica. This initializes the server’s replica map so that every signer has a local copy of the Entity state.
* **applyCommand integration**: Once the correct `rep` is identified, we call `applyCommand(rep, cmd)` to get an updated replica state. We then update the `replicas` Map with this new state.
* **Post-effects (Outbox generation)**: The server FSM monitors certain events and emits follow-up commands (as new `Input` messages) to drive the consensus protocol forward:

  * After a **PROPOSE**: If a proposal was successfully created (`updatedRep.proposal` exists where previously `rep.proposal` did not), the server enqueues a `SIGN` request to every other signer in the quorum. These `SIGN` requests have `from` set to each signer’s address and `to` set to the proposer’s address (though logically they will be delivered to each signer’s replica).
  * After a **SIGN**: It checks if the new signature raised the total collected voting power from below threshold to equal/above threshold. If the threshold is now reached, it means the frame has enough signatures to commit, so the proposer will send out a `COMMIT`. The server enqueues a single `COMMIT` message (with `to: '*'` indicating broadcast to all replicas) containing the aggregated signature placeholder and the full frame.

    * The power calculation here is simplified: `power()` uses `sigs.size` (count of signatures) since all signers have equal weight in this MVP. In a general case, `power()` would sum the weights of the signers in `proposal.sigs` and compare to `quorum.threshold`.
  * After an **ADD\_TX**: If a transaction was added and the replica isn’t currently in a proposal round, the server schedules a `PROPOSE` for that same replica (proposer). This ensures that as soon as any signer adds a transaction, the proposer will attempt to include it in a frame on the next tick. Essentially, it triggers block creation as long as there are new transactions.
* **ServerFrame creation**: Once all inputs in the batch are processed and all state transitions applied, the server computes the **Merkle root** of the global state. `computeRoot` in this MVP simply hashes the JSON of all replicas’ states (this is a stand-in for a real Merkle tree; a proper Patricia trie or Merkle tree could be used in future). This root is placed in `ServerFrame.root`. Then the code assembles a `ServerFrame` object for this tick, including:

  * `height`: incremented by 1 for each tick.
  * `ts`: the timestamp provided.
  * `inputs`: the list of `Input` processed this tick (for audit trail).
  * `root`: the computed state root of all replicas after applying the inputs.
  * `hash`: computed last, as Keccak-256 of the RLP encoding of `[height, ts, inputs, root]` (excluding the hash field). This `hash` is effectively the **identifier** of the ServerFrame. It proves the contents of the frame and links to the prior frame via the height. In a real deployment, this hash could be periodically published on-chain or to a beacon for accountability.
* The function returns the new `ServerState` (with updated replicas and height), the `ServerFrame` for this tick, and any `outbox` messages that need to be delivered in the next cycle.

By producing a ServerFrame each tick and writing it to a log (to be implemented), we gain durability and a verifiable history. In case of a crash, one can replay from the last snapshot by feeding all recorded ServerFrames through `applyServerBlock` and verifying that the final `root` matches. This way, any tampering with state is detectable by a root hash mismatch, as described in the specification.

#### src/core/runtime.ts

The `Runtime` class ties everything together, simulating a running server by driving `applyServerBlock` every 100ms and performing the necessary side-effects like generating actual cryptographic signatures and broadcasting messages. This is the **only** part of the code that deals with real time, private keys, and console output. It orchestrates the consensus by fulfilling the signature requests and commit aggregation that the pure state machines schedule via placeholders.

```ts
import { applyServerBlock } from './server';
import { sign, aggregate, randomPriv, pub, addr } from '../crypto/bls';
import { Input, Replica, Frame, EntityState, Quorum } from '../types';

/* ──────────── Deterministic demo key generation (5 signers) ──────────── */
const PRIVS = Array.from({ length: 5 }, () => randomPriv());
const PUBS  = PRIVS.map(pub);
const ADDRS = PUBS.map(addr);

/* ──────────── Bootstrap an initial Replica (genesis state) ──────────── */
const genesisEntity = (): Replica => {
  const quorum: Quorum = {
    threshold: 3,  // require 3 out of 5 signatures to commit (simple majority)
    members: Object.fromEntries(
      ADDRS.map(a => [a, { nonce: 0n, shares: 1 }])
    )
  };
  const initState: EntityState = { quorum, chat: [] };
  const initFrame: Frame<EntityState> = { height: 0n, ts: 0, txs: [], state: initState };
  return {
    address: { jurisdiction: 'demo', entityId: 'chat' },
    proposer: ADDRS[0],               // initial proposer (could be rotated later)
    isAwaitingSignatures: false,
    mempool: [],
    last: initFrame
    // proposal: undefined (implicitly)
  };
};

export class Runtime {
  private state: { replicas: Map<string, Replica>; height: bigint }
    = { replicas: new Map(), height: 0n };

  constructor() {
    // Initialize a replica for each signer in the demo entity:
    const base = genesisEntity();
    ADDRS.forEach(signerAddr => {
      const rep: Replica = { ...base, proposer: signerAddr };
      this.state.replicas.set(`demo:chat:${signerAddr}`, rep);
    });
    this.state.height = 0n;
  }

  /** Drive one 100ms tick of the server. Provide current time and any incoming Inputs. */
  async tick(now: number, incoming: Input[]) {
    // Step 1: apply the pure server logic to get the next state and ServerFrame
    const { state: nextState, frame, outbox } = applyServerBlock(this.state, incoming, now);

    // Step 2: fulfill signature placeholders in outbox (where private keys are used)
    const fulfilledOutbox = await Promise.all(outbox.map(async msg => {
      if (msg.cmd.type === 'SIGN' && msg.cmd.sig === '0x00') {
        // Sign the frame hash with the signer's private key
        const signerIndex = ADDRS.findIndex(a => a === msg.cmd.signer);
        msg.cmd.sig = await sign(Buffer.from(msg.cmd.frameHash.slice(2), 'hex'), PRIVS[signerIndex]);
      }
      if (msg.cmd.type === 'COMMIT' && msg.cmd.hanko === '0x00') {
        // Aggregate all collected signatures into one Hanko, and remove individual sigs from frame
        const sigsMap = (msg.cmd.frame as any).sigs as Map<string, string>;
        msg.cmd.hanko = aggregate([...sigsMap.values()]);
        delete (msg.cmd.frame as any).sigs;
        delete (msg.cmd.frame as any).hash;
      }
      return msg;
    }));

    // Step 3: (Placeholder for actual networking/persistence)
    // For now, just log the ServerFrame and update state.
    console.log(`Committed ServerFrame #${frame.height.toString()} – hash: ${frame.hash.slice(0, 10)}... root: ${frame.root.slice(0, 10)}...`);

    // In a real node, here we would:
    // - Append `frame` to WAL (with fsync)
    // - Possibly take a snapshot of state or prune WAL
    // - Broadcast the outbox messages over network to respective peers

    // Update the in-memory server state for next tick
    this.state = nextState;
    // Return outbox and frame for further processing or inspection
    return { outbox: fulfilledOutbox, frame };
  }
}
```

Key points:

* **Key Generation**: For demonstration, we generate 5 random private keys (`randomPriv()`) and derive their public keys and addresses. These represent the 5 signers of our Entity. In practice, keys might come from a keystore or config, but here it’s deterministic for each run (to simulate known participants).
* **Genesis Setup**: `genesisEntity()` creates an initial `Replica` with a brand new Entity state:

  * All 5 signers have `nonce: 0` and `shares: 1` in the quorum.
  * The quorum threshold is set to 3 (meaning at least 3 out of 5 signatures are needed to commit a frame — a simple majority, tolerating up to 1 Byzantine fault).
  * The initial chat log is empty, and the initial Frame (height 0) contains no transactions.
  * We then create one Replica per signer (cloning this initial state but setting a different `proposer` for each). Initially, each signer’s replica is identical except for the `proposer` field. All these replicas are stored in the server’s state map keyed by `demo:chat:<signerAddr>`.
* **tick() method**: This simulates one cycle (tick) of the server:

  1. **Pure Step**: Calls `applyServerBlock` with the current state, incoming inputs, and the current timestamp. This returns the next state, a ServerFrame, and an outbox of follow-up messages (some with placeholders for signatures).
  2. **Signature Fulfillment**: Iterates over the outbox:

     * For each `SIGN` message with `sig: '0x00'`, it finds the corresponding signer’s private key and produces a real signature on the frame hash.
     * For a `COMMIT` with `hanko: '0x00'`, it aggregates all the partial sigs collected in `frame.sigs` into one `hanko` signature (using `aggregate()`), then strips out the individual sigs and the `hash` from the frame (so the frame in the commit becomes a clean final Frame object without the proposal metadata).
     * These operations use the BLS functions and are done asynchronously (`await sign(...)`) since BLS signing is asynchronous in the library.
  3. **Output / Persistence**: In this MVP, instead of actual network transmission or database writes, we simply log the committed ServerFrame’s height and truncated hash and root (for verification). In a full implementation, here the `frame` would be written to a WAL (Write-Ahead Log) and the outbox messages would be sent over UDP/TCP or a p2p network to other servers.
  4. **State Update**: The in-memory server state is updated to `nextState` for the next tick. The function returns the `outbox` and `frame` for potential use (for example, in tests or a demo harness to inspect what happened).

By design, all cryptographic signing happens **outside** the pure state transitions. The state machine only sees placeholders (`'0x00'`) and treats them as opaque values. This separation ensures the core logic remains deterministic and testable, while the runtime deals with actual keys and unpredictable timing of real operations.

**Consensus Flow Recap:** Here’s how a single chat message flows through the system step-by-step:

1. **User Transaction**: A client creates a `ChatTx` with their message (say `"Hello"`) signed by their BLS key. They send it as an `ADD_TX` input to the server.
2. **Tick 1**: On the next 100ms tick, the server processes `ADD_TX`: the transaction is added to the proposer’s mempool. Because the proposer wasn’t in a proposing state, the server enqueues a `PROPOSE` for that entity (to be processed on the next tick).
3. **Tick 2**: The `PROPOSE` input is processed. The proposer’s replica takes all mempool txs (our "Hello" message), creates a ProposedFrame (Frame height 1, containing the chat tx and updated state), with its own signature placeholder. The server, seeing a new proposal, emits `SIGN` requests to all other 4 signers.
4. **Tick 3**: Each signer’s replica processes the `SIGN` command: each verifies the frame hash and updates their `proposal.sigs` with their own placeholder signature. As signatures come in, once the 3rd signature is added (threshold 3 reached), the server enqueues a `COMMIT`.
5. **Tick 4**: The `COMMIT` is processed by all replicas: they verify the frame hash and aggregate signature (the runtime filled in the actual `hanko`), then accept the new frame as committed. The new chat message now appears in each replica’s state (`chat` log), and `isAwaitingSignatures` resets. The server writes a ServerFrame for this tick, which contains the state root after the commit. All replicas have the same Entity state and Merkle root, which would match the one in the ServerFrame, proving consistency.

This protocol (`ADD_TX → PROPOSE → SIGN → COMMIT`) is minimal yet achieves Byzantine agreement on each chat message with **finality** once committed. By using aggregate BLS signatures (Hanko), the overhead remains low: one signature per signer per frame, aggregated into one 48-byte signature in commits, which is more efficient than collecting many separate signatures. The Merkle root in each ServerFrame acts as a **global state checkpoint**, similar to how Ethereum uses a state root in each block to allow fast comparison of states without transmitting entire state.

## 3. Implemented Features and Security

The current MVP implements the core consensus and state management features described in the spec:

| Component         | Status        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity FSM**    | ✔️ Complete   | All five command types handled (`IMPORT` via server). Enforces per-signer nonces and quorum threshold logic. Transactions are deterministically ordered to prevent race conditions. |
| **Server FSM**    | ✔️ Complete   | Batches inputs into ticks (100ms cadence), routes to replicas, forms ServerFrames with global state root. Generates follow-up messages (SIGN, COMMIT) deterministically.            |
| **BLS Crypto**    | ✔️ Integrated | Uses noble BLS12-381 for keygen, sign, verify. Supports aggregation (Hanko). Ensures authenticity and integrity of transactions and frames (no forging).                            |
| **Frame Hashing** | ✔️ (temp)     | Frame hash computed (currently via JSON+Keccak) for proposal identity. Will switch to RLP-based hashing for full canonical consistency.                                             |
| **Codec (RLP)**   | ✔️ Complete   | RLP serialization for inputs, frames, and server frames. Ensures deterministic binary format for hashing and signing.                                                               |
| **Runtime Shell** | ✔️ Complete   | Drives the tick loop, fills in signatures, logs output. Demonstrates end-to-end flow in a single-process simulation.                                                                |
| **Persistence**   | ⏳ Planned     | Not implemented in MVP. Placeholders for writing ServerFrame to WAL and taking state snapshots exist in comments. Will provide crash recovery via replay and audit trail.           |
| **Networking**    | ⏳ Planned     | Not implemented in MVP. Currently, outbox is returned for local processing. In future, will send `Input` messages over network to other replicas.                                   |

**Security considerations** at this stage:

* *Message Authenticity*: Every Entity transaction (`tx.sig`) and final commit (`Hanko`) is verified (or at least verifiable). Only a holder of a signer’s private key can produce a valid signature. `applyCommand` checks each `SIGN` and `COMMIT` against known hashes and uses `verifyAggregate` to ensure the Hanko is valid (in a real run, we'd supply actual public keys to that function).
* *Replay Attacks*: Prevented by nonces. Each signer’s `SignerRecord.nonce` is incremented only when their tx is accepted into a frame, and `applyTx` will reject any tx with a nonce that doesn’t exactly match the expected value. Thus, old messages can’t be replayed; duplicates are ignored.
* *Order Fairness*: The deterministic sorting of transactions and the ability for any signer to trigger a proposal if the current leader stalls ensure no single node can indefinitely reorder or block transactions. Every 100ms tick, if the designated proposer doesn’t act and another signer has a transaction, that other signer’s `ADD_TX` will cause a proposal to happen on the next tick.
* *Censorship Resistance*: Because any quorum member can initiate a proposal when they have a pending tx (the code triggers `PROPOSE` automatically on `ADD_TX`), a malicious proposer cannot indefinitely stall the inclusion of transactions. Others will step up and propose their own frames if needed.
* *State Consistency*: The Merkle `root` in each ServerFrame acts as a commitment to the entire world state. Two nodes can simply compare their latest state roots to detect any divergence. If a malicious server tries to deviate (produce a different state), its root hash in the ServerFrame will differ from honest nodes, and the discrepancy will be evident. During recovery or cross-validation, any mismatch between a recomputed state root and a logged root would flag a potential issue.
* *Crash Recovery*: Though not fully implemented, the design anticipates writing each ServerFrame to a WAL and taking periodic state snapshots. After a crash, the node would read the last snapshot and replay all subsequent ServerFrames through `applyServerBlock` to reconstruct state. Because `applyServerBlock` is deterministic and the frames are signed, the node can verify the integrity of the recovery by checking that the final state’s Merkle root matches the last frame’s root. This ensures that any corrupted log or tampering is detected (the node would halt or alert if a mismatch is found).

## 4. Next Steps and Future Enhancements

The MVP is intentionally minimal. Here are the next engineering tasks and features to be addressed as we evolve towards the full XLN network:

1. **Canonical Frame Hashing** – Replace the temporary JSON-based `hashFrame` with true RLP-based hashing. Since we have `encFrame` implemented, we can compute `hashFrame = keccak256(encFrame(frame))` to align exactly with how the frame is encoded for signing. This will lock in the frame identity across heterogeneous implementations.
2. **Persistence Layer (WAL & Snapshots)** – Implement a storage module (e.g., using LevelDB) to write ServerFrames to disk (WAL) and take periodic snapshots of Entity state (e.g., every N frames or M seconds). Ensure atomic writes (append to WAL then snapshot) and handle WAL truncation after successful snapshots to prevent unbounded growth. This will enable crash recovery and historical audit.
3. **Networking (Transport)** – Implement the network layer (`net/transport.ts`) to send and receive `Input` messages over a real network. The current code assumes an outbox is delivered next tick internally; with real networking, the outbox should be serialized (via `encInput`) and sent to the appropriate peer (as indicated by the `to` address or broadcast). Similarly, incoming packets must be decoded to `Input` and fed into `runtime.tick`.
4. **Proposer Rotation / View Changes** – In this MVP, the first signer is always the proposer for simplicity. We should implement a fair rotation or leader election for the proposer role per Entity (e.g., round-robin or a VRF-based leader selection) to distribute responsibility and avoid a single point of failure. This involves tracking whose turn it is each frame and possibly introducing a timeout mechanism to trigger view changes if the current proposer fails to propose in time.
5. **Additional Transaction Types** – Extend `EntityState` to include channel or account data structures (for payments), and introduce new transaction types (`open_channel`, `transfer`, etc.). The consensus core can handle them similarly to chat messages by applying deterministic logic for each new kind of transaction.
6. **Light Client Support** – Enhance the Merkle tree logic in `computeRoot` to a proper binary Merkle tree or Patricia trie, and implement proof generation. This would allow light clients to ask full nodes for proofs of specific messages or balances. A full node would provide a Merkle proof from that item up to the `ServerFrame.root`, along with the Hanko-signed ServerFrame. Verifying the proof against the root and the Hanko signature would give the light client trustless assurance of the state.
7. **Jurisdiction Layer Integration** – Introduce an on-chain smart contract (the **Depositary**) and logic to periodically anchor ServerFrame hashes or state roots on-chain. This would provide an external source of truth and finality, securing the off-chain network against collusion beyond the BFT quorum assumption.

The code structure is designed to accommodate these extensions without significant changes to core logic. The layering (Core vs. Adapters) means we can plug in persistence and networking as needed, and add new transaction types in Entity logic relatively easily. The consensus mechanism (BFT with aggregated signatures) will remain central as we add these features.

## 5. Running the Demo

To run the included demo or tests using **Bun**:

* Install dependencies (e.g. `bun install` to get Noble libraries).
* Create a small script (or use `index.ts`) to drive the `Runtime` ticks and feed it inputs.

The `src/index.ts` can be a simple harness to simulate a basic chat flow. For example:

```ts
import { Runtime } from './core/runtime';
import { Input, Transaction } from './types';
import { sign } from './crypto/bls';

// Initialize the runtime (which sets up the 5 signers and genesis state)
const runtime = new Runtime();

// Prepare a chat transaction from one of the signers (say the first signer)
const fromAddr = (global as any).ADDRS[0];  // assume we exposed ADDRS for demo
const privKey = (global as any).PRIVS[0];   // corresponding private key
const chatTx: Transaction = {
  kind: 'chat',
  nonce: 0n,
  from: fromAddr,
  body: { message: 'Hello, XLN!' },
  sig: '0x00'  // placeholder for now
};

(async () => {
  // Sign the transaction (in a real setting, client does this; here we simulate)
  chatTx.sig = await sign(Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(chatTx.body)), privKey);
  const addTxInput: Input = {
    from: fromAddr,
    to: fromAddr,
    cmd: { type: 'ADD_TX', addrKey: 'demo:chat', tx: chatTx }
  };

  console.log('Tick 1: initial tick (no input)');
  await runtime.tick(Date.now(), []);   // initial tick, no inputs

  console.log('Tick 2: process ADD_TX');
  const { outbox: out1 } = await runtime.tick(Date.now() + 100, [ addTxInput ]);

  console.log('Tick 3: process PROPOSE -> SIGN (outbox from tick 2)');
  const { outbox: out2 } = await runtime.tick(Date.now() + 200, out1);

  console.log('Tick 4: process COMMIT (outbox from tick 3)');
  const { frame: finalFrame } = await runtime.tick(Date.now() + 300, out2);

  console.log('Final chat log state:', finalFrame.state.chat);
})();
```

*(The above is a simplified demo. In the actual code, `PRIVS` and `ADDRS` are encapsulated in the `Runtime` module, so you might expose them or adjust the design for testing. The main idea is to simulate adding a transaction and progressing the ticks.)*

When you run a similar sequence, you should see console output for committed ServerFrames. For example:

```
Tick 1: initial tick (no input)
Committed ServerFrame #1 – hash: 0xabc12345... root: 0xdef67890...
Tick 2: process ADD_TX
Committed ServerFrame #2 – hash: 0x1234abcd... root: 0x9abcdeff...
Tick 3: process PROPOSE -> SIGN
Committed ServerFrame #3 – hash: 0x5555aaaa... root: 0x7777bbbb...
Tick 4: process COMMIT
Committed ServerFrame #4 – hash: 0x9999cccc... root: 0xddddeeee...
Final chat log state: [ { from: '0x....', msg: 'Hello, XLN!', ts: <timestamp> } ]
```

Each committed ServerFrame indicates the state has progressed. The final state’s chat log contains the message "Hello, XLN!" with the sender’s address and a timestamp, confirming that the message was agreed upon by the quorum and applied. All replicas (signers) would have this same log entry in their state, and the Merkle root in the ServerFrame reflects this inclusion.

You can inspect the `Runtime`’s internal state (its `replicas` map) after the final tick to see that each replica’s `chat` log contains the new message and that all replicas share the same Merkle root (the first 10 hex chars shown in logs should match for all).

## 6. Understanding **ServerFrame** in Context

Finally, it’s worth emphasizing **why the ServerFrame is important** in this architecture:

* **Ledger of Events**: It serves as a *ledger of each tick*, recording what inputs were processed and what the resulting state root is. It’s like a block in a blockchain but at a higher frequency (every 100ms, in this design) and without heavy proof-of-work. Instead, it’s secured by BLS signatures and the trust assumptions of the quorums.
* **State Commitments**: By hashing and including the state root, it provides a compact commitment to the entire off-chain state at that point in time. Two nodes can simply compare the latest ServerFrame.hash or .root to see if they are in sync. If not, one can request missing frames or reconcile differences.
* **Integrity and Audit**: In a multi-node deployment, ServerFrames would be gossiped among servers for cross-jurisdiction consistency. Periodically, a ServerFrame’s hash (or the aggregate of several) could be anchored on Ethereum (or another chain) to guard against history revision (giving an external checkpoint of state). For forensic analysis, the WAL of ServerFrames and the content-addressed storage of committed Entity frames provide a verifiable history. Any dispute can be resolved by examining these records: for example, if a signer claims a message was not delivered, the presence of that message in a committed frame with the signer's signature (via the Hanko) is irrefutable proof of consensus.
* **Recovery**: During recovery, a node replays ServerFrames to rebuild state. If any single bit were off (due to corruption or malicious alteration), the mismatch in hash or root would be detected. The Merkle root and signatures ensure that a node can’t unknowingly diverge from the agreed state without detection.

In summary, this MVP code delivers a fully deterministic, BFT-consensus chat system using aggregate BLS signatures and a robust layering. It strictly follows the design principles of pure functions for consensus logic, clear separation of concerns, and alignment with blockchain-inspired data integrity techniques (like RLP encoding, Keccak hashing, and state Merkle roots). While simplified (single process, no actual network or persistent storage yet, and using a placeholder for frame hashing), it lays the groundwork for a production-ready off-chain network where multiple signers can reach agreement on arbitrary state updates quickly and securely.
