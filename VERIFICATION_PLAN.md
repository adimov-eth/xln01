# XLN v02 Verification & Polishing Plan

## Overview

This plan verifies the v02 implementation against:

1. [XLN Specification v1.4.1-RC2](https://github.com/adimov-eth/thoughts/blob/main/docs/spec.md)
2. Code quality standards established in CLAUDE.md
3. Production readiness requirements

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Implemented Core Features

- **BFT Consensus**: ADD_TX → PROPOSE → SIGN → COMMIT flow
- **BLS Signatures**: Aggregate signature verification (BLS12-381)
- **RLP Encoding**: Ethereum-compatible serialization
- **WAL Persistence**: LevelDB-based crash recovery
- **Leader Rotation**: Deterministic proposer selection
- **Multi-Entity Support**: Global merkle root computation
- **Test Coverage**: 91.17% line coverage

### ✅ Specification Compliance (Completed)

#### 1. Frame Structure - FIXED ✅

**Spec Requirement**: Implemented with backward compatibility

```typescript
interface Frame<T> {
	// New spec-compliant fields
	header?: FrameHeader; // Contains height, timestamp (bigint), parentHash, proposer
	body?: FrameBody<T>; // Contains transactions and optional state

	// Legacy fields (maintained for compatibility)
	height: UInt64;
	ts: number;
	txs: Transaction[];
	state: T;
}
```

#### 2. Transaction Sorting - FIXED ✅

**Spec**: Sort by `nonce → signerId → kind` - Implemented correctly

#### 3. Missing Layers

- **Jurisdiction Layer**: Not explicitly implemented (merged into Server)
- **Signer Layer**: Logic distributed between Entity and Runtime

## Verification Tasks

### Phase 1: Specification Compliance (Priority: HIGH) ✅ COMPLETED

#### Task 1.1: Fix Frame Structure ✅

- [x] Add `parentHash` field to Frame interface
- [x] Add `proposer` field to Frame interface

- [x] Update tests for new structure

#### Task 1.2: Fix Transaction Sorting ✅

## Notes

### Architectural Decisions to Document

1. Why Jurisdiction and Signer layers were merged
2. Rationale for using number timestamps internally
3. Trade-offs in leader rotation implementation
4. Design choices in WAL implementation

### Future Considerations

1. Formal verification preparation
2. Network transport layer design
3. Cross-jurisdiction bridging
4. On-chain anchoring protocol
